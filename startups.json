Tezbid provides the sellers with a convenient online marketplace to obtain the best price. At the same time they will be passing their cherished items to a fellow collector. The buyers on the other hand get a wide selection of inventory at market prices.\nAs long term collectors ourselves, we understand the pride of ownership in a unique, well put together collection. Personally speaking, we have learnt a lot about different countries, governments, economy and history by the study of their currencies and stamps. We see Tezbid as a community of collectors that continues to propagate the curiosity and the sense of wonder we felt when we started collecting in the 1980's.",

BubbleNut Wash propagates the use of organic forest products and helps the local communities.\nBubbleNut Wash has taken up the task to work to identify unique forest products that have market potential in the mainstream society and can hence benefit the community economically. To begin with, it has identified soapnuts as a commercially viable product. Soapnuts are a natural cleaning device that have been used for hair wash, dish wash and laundry wash for centuries. However, these nuts grow on some of the toughest terrains, either on the Himalayan slopes or deep inside the forests of peninsular India. BubbleNut Wash works mobilizes unprivileged rural women into producer groups who work to collect soapnuts all through Autumn and Spring seasons. They are trained to sort, grade, dry and pack and ship soapnuts for washing machine use. The market access provided by BubbleNut Wash enables women producer groups to generate additional income that can be spent on their children’s education and health.",

    "description": "Merlin Solar Technologies, like many of its Silicon Valley compatriots, was founded in a garage. The founders set out to fundamentally rethink the way solar panels were engineered with the goal of ubiquitous deployment. “To boldly go where no solar panel has gone before” remains the mantra of our company, having successfully deployed solar panels in some of the harshest environments. With panels in space, war zones, Norwegian fjords, Class 8 trucks, RVs, disaster recovery vehicles, autonomous ocean going drones, O&G Storage tanks, tensioned fabric canopies – in addition to traditional deployments – we seek to conquer new horizons.\n\nThe founders have a combined expertise of over 200 man-years in semiconductor, solar, photonics, flexible displays, and high throughput automation. This combination of expertise has resulted in a portfolio of 50+ international patents & delivered products that are acknowledged to be the best-in-class. Our lightweight, flexible, peel & stick, rugged, and high efficiency mono-crystalline panels are simultaneously incremental and disruptive. Together with our customers & partners, MerlinSolar™ is well on its way to make the world rethink what solar energy is capable of. We hope you will join us in making this mission a reality.
